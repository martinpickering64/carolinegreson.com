These have been, and are continuing to be, difficult times for us all. I constantly give thanks for my family's good health but am desperately sad at how Covid has affected friends and acquaintances throughout the basketmaking community and beyond. I hope you and those you know have kept safe.

I am unable to run my willow sculpture workshops under the present restrictions. I know there are many of you who have had to postpone booked workshop sessions over the past year and I want to reassure you that as soon as it is permissible I will be in touch to reorganize some new dates.

I miss meeting and teaching all you willow sculpture keenies enormously.

I am continuing to make willow sculptures and baskets from my home studio and for that I am thankful.

Feel free to contact me if you would like something made for your own garden or as a present to cheer up someone you care about. And as I frequently say, I always love a challenge!
