With great regret I have cancelled my willow sculpture workshop that was due to be held at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham on 24th April. With the current travel restrictions still in place and with no indication of when we might be able to return to a more normal state of affairs I feel I have no choice.

All registered participants will be able to transfer their booking to an alternative date.
