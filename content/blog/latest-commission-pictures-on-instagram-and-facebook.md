If you want to see all my latest willow sculpture and basket work follow me on Facebook or Instagram. It is so quick and easy to upload a quick snap before my work leaves me for its new home.

They are not always the highest quality photos, so don't necessarily make it into my website gallery. And in these times of lockdown there are more than a few taken in my garden so you can also check if I have been doing the weeding!
