In the light of Covid restrictions on my teaching, especially in schools, I find myself in the unusual position of having extra time in my studio. If you would like to commission me to make a sculpture, then waiting times are much shorter than normal. With all the additional attention that gardens have been getting this year what could be nicer than a willow sculpture to act as a completely environmentally friendly focal point.

Browse my gallery for inspiration or send me a photo of animal or figure you would like me to create. I love a challenge!
