I have just released a new date for my willow sculpture day workshop at Castle Park Arts Centre. You can make whatever you like with the only restriction being the time we have. I don't want you to go home with an unfinished sculpture. Talk to me if you would like to discuss ideas.

This will be my closest workshop to Christmas so if you fancy a reindeer head or an angel or even a snowman this could be your opportunity. I am happy to help you make less Christmassy animals too!

Full details on my Workshops page of the website.

Hope to see you there.
