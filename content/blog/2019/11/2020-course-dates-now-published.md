All the willow sculpture workshop dates which will be taught by Caroline Gregson in 2020 are now listed in the Workshops area of my website.

I will be teaching several single day workshops at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire throughout the year.

I have two separate 2 day courses, in May and September, arranged with Zantium Studios near Wirksworth in Derbyshire.

I will also be teaching two 2-day willow sculpture courses at The Woodland Skills Centre at Bodfari in Denbighshire. One in June and the second in September.

I am looking forward to working with everyone.
