If you would like to learn how to make your own willow sculptures, then I will be teaching 1 day sculpture workshops at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham and 2 day sculpture workshops at Zantium Studios in the Derbyshire Peak District as well as at The Woodland Skills Centre Bodfari in Denbighshire.

I don't dictate what you make and am always up for a challenge. Happy to help you make your dream sculpture! The only limit is the available time. Get in touch if you would like to discuss your plans.

Dates are now up in the Workshops pages of my website.

You can book the day workshops directly by emailing me.

The 2 day workshop bookings are handled by the venues themselves.
