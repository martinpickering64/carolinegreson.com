The images in my Gallery are of Willow Sculptures I have made as commissions or 
for exhibitions. Every Willow Sculpture is unique so although I am more than happy 
to recreate something you see here, I can also adjust the pose and size to fit 
with your own ideas - and I always like a new challenge. 

If you would like to discuss the possibilities do feel free to [get in touch with me](/#contact).
