Well, where has the year gone? It has been wonderfully busy and I have been very fortunate to work on lots of exciting commissions as well as meeting so many talented people on my willow sculpture workshops all over the country.

It is now time to plan for 2023.

I will be releasing dates for my day sculpture workshops at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham very soon. All the workshops will be listed on my website and you can reserve a place by contacting me by email or phone.

I will also be teaching my popular 2 day sculpture workshops at Zantium Studios in the Peak District and at The Woodland Skills Centre in Denbighshire.

Hopefully I will see you at one of these workshops next year.
