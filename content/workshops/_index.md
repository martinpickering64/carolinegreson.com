I run my own Willow Sculpture Workshops and Basketry Workshops from time to time 
to assist those who are interested in exploring working with Willow to create 
their own Sculptures and Baskets.

My workshops are quite informal and are structured around the needs and 
interests of those who attend. You won't be limited to making something 
that I decide, in fact the only limitation will be the time we have. If 
you have a particular idea I am very happy to talk with you beforehand 
about the feasibility of completing the sculpture within the day. Equally 
don't worry if you don't know what to make before you arrive. We can always 
discuss some possibilities during the first part of the workshop.

I can supply Gift Cards that make excellent presents and can be redeemed 
for Willow Sculptures, Willow Sculpture Workshops or Basketry Workshops to 
the value of the card, or in part payment for a sculpture or a workshop.

If you would like to book a place on any of my workshops, please [contact me](/#contact).

Here are the upcoming Workshops that I will be running:
