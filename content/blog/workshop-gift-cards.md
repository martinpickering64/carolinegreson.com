If you are stuck for ideas as to what to buy someone for Christmas why not consider a Willow Workshop Gift Card.

These can be redeemed at any time over the next 12 months to cover the cost of one of my Willow Sculpture Day Workshops held at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire.

I have dates available throughout 2022.

All bookings are freely transferable in the event of any Covid restrictions.
