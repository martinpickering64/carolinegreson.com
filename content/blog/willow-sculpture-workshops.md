Assuming no instructions to the contrary come from the Government, I will be restarting my Willow Sculpture Workshops in September. See the Workshop area of the website for dates and more information.

For the time being there will be no more than 4 people attending at a time thus ensuring we can maintain social distancing. The workshops may take place at my home studio in Tarvin using both my studio space and gazebo covered lawn. At the present time I don't know whether my normal venue at Castle Park Arts Centre will be available.

If you have any questions then please feel free to contact me.
