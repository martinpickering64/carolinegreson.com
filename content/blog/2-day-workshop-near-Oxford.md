summary: >-
  I will be teaching a 2-day willow sculpture workshop at Starlight Cottage,
  Carswell Marsh between Oxford and Faringdon on 23rd/24th August 2023. There
  are no resrictions on what you can make other than the time so let your
  imagination run wild! I am happy to discuss ideas beforehand if you'd like to
  talk to me. Details and bookings are being handled directly through
  starlightcottage.co.uk

  This will be my last workshop in the south of England this year. Don't miss
  it!
