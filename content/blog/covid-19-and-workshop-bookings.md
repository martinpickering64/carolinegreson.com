As we find ourselves in these tricky times, I feel I need to clarify my position for those of you who have already booked or are thinking of booking a place on one of my workshops. I  think I have emailed everyone directly who is already booked on one of my 1 day workshops, 2 day workshop participants will be contacted by either Zantium Studios or The Woodland Skills Centre directly.

With recommendations and rulings changing daily at the moment it is difficult to make any fixed plans. I am monitoring the situation closely and will follow any rulings to the letter.

Please be assured that if a workshop needs to be cancelled you will be able to transfer at no charge to another available date.

With all that in mind if you would like something to look forward to or if a friend or relative needs some cheering up, I am still able to provide workshop gift vouchers which can be redeemed for any of my one day workshops.

Stay safe everyone and I hope to see you sometime soon.
