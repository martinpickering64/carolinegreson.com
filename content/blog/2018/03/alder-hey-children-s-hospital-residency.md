My willow sculpture "The Apiary" has now been installed in the Radiology Courtyard at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. This piece is the legacy arising from my residency working with children, families and staff on one of the surgical wards over 16 sessions during the autumn of 2017.

There is also a sculpture of a slinking fox made in conjunction with the children and staff on Ward 3A installed on the play deck at the end of the ward.
