New dates for the remaining 2018 willow sculpture workshops are now on my workshops page.

I don't dictate what you can make during the day and am quite happy to help you to work in an abstract way if animals aren't your thing. Most people complete some sort of bird in a day but if you work quickly then the sky's the limit!

In past years my November workshop has become a bit Christmas themed, with reindeer heads and other decorations proving popular, but I'm happy to show you whatever you like.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss ideas (and check that your project is achievable in the time we have).

Book early as these workshops do tend to fill quickly.
