Workshop to learn how to make willow sculptures. You can choose what you make. This one-day workshop shows you the techniques and materials I use in my own work to create sculptures from willow. The group is kept small so you will get help when you need it.

The workshop is held at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire and runs from 10AM to 4PM (bring your own lunch or buy some in the excellent Arts Centre Cafe).

Previous experience of basketry or working with willow is not essential. At the end of the day you will be able to take home your completed sculpture. Previous workshops have resulted in chickens, ducks, herons, and other birds or stag trophy heads, and for those with more experience pigs, cats, hares etc.

All tools and materials are provided.
