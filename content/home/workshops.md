subtitle = "Covid-19 restrictions are still limiting my ability to run a full schedule of workshops but I am starting to organise dates at my favourite venues for later this year. Hopefully as we release from the various levels of lockdown I will be able to organise some more of my popular willow sculpture and basketry workshops. In the meantime restrictions allowing, I am also teaching individuals from my home studio. If you are interested please contact me. I run courses and workshops in Willow Sculpture and Basketmaking throughout the year, here are some of my upcoming workshops, or you can [see all of them here](/workshops)"
