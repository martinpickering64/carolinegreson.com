As most of my pieces are made to a commission and all are hand-made individual items, 
delivery of these items also tends to be a personalised and bespoke arrangement.

For many items I use Parcelforce and I price delivery with that in mind. If at any 
point in time that arrangement and price cannot be honoured then I will contact 
you first of all to ensure that you know and agree to whatever other arrangements we arrive at.

In any event, despatch will only take place once the item has been completed 
and you have seen and approved an image of your finished sculpture. At this point, 
we will agree a date for despatch and the sculpture should be with you within 
two working days of this date.
