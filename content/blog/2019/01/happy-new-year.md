Happy New Year!

2019 is going to be interesting in many ways (and I'm not going to mention the dreaded B****T that is looming).

I am going to be working as part of a team building a replica Bronze Age Round House at Beeston Castle in Cheshire. We start making our authentic Bronze Age tools in a couple of weeks and then it will be full steam ahead harvesting materials and creating the timber frame. Hopefully we will be thatching, and wattle and daubing to complete the project in May. It will then fall to us to make the furniture, tools and other items that would have furnished such a house at that time. Exciting times, and what an opportunity to be part of it.

I will of course have time to be working on my own sculptures as well during this period. So business as usual!
