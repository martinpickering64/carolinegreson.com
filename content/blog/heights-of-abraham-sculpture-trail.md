I have been delighted to make five groups of figures and animals in willow sculpture form that represent historical connections with the area. They are displayed around the park at the Heights of Abraham in Matlock Bath and can be viewed as part of the entrance price. The figures include the Regency woman on a donkey and her guide as shown in this image. This was once the way wealthy visitors (including Queen Victoria) visited the pleasure gardens at The Heights. Other figures include a Shepherd with his Dog and a flock of Sheep, a Lead Miner and his Son, Children playing and a Stag and Deer.
