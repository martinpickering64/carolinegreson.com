Due to cancellation I now have 2 spaces available on my next Willow Sculpture Workshop at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire. Friday 18th February 2022.

The room is large, with good ventilation and I request that everyone be fully vaccinated and should wear facemasks. In the event of cancellation due to Covid related issues, places can be transferred to a workshop later in the year.

Further details in my Workshops section of the website but feel free to contact me if you have questions or would like to book a place.

Hope to see you there!
