I have loved and been inspired by the natural world since I was a child 
and the ability to work as a Willow Artist and make willow sculptures 
representing the essence of animals, birds and other living forms now 
brings me great pleasure. I love to represent movement and vitality in 
my work. My willow sculptures appear to have just paused in their setting 
before they are ready to move on. One of the nicest things anyone has 
said about my animal sculptures is that you can always see where 
they are looking!

The excellence of Caroline's work as a Willow Artist and Basketmaker has 
been recognised by her admission as Yeoman member of the Worshipful 
Company of Basketmakers.
