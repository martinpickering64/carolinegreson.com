The images in my Gallery are of Willow Sculptures I have made as commissions or
for exhibitions. Every Willow Sculpture is unique so although I am more than happy
to recreate something you see here, I can also adjust the pose and size to fit
with your own ideas - and I always like a new challenge.

If you would like to discuss the possibilities do feel free to [get in touch with me](/#contact "").
