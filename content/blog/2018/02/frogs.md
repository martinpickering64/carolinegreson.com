Spring must be on its way at last, the frogs have started arriving back in my pond today. Bulbs are starting to show their spiky leaves above ground and my thoughts are turning to seed sowing.

I have one place left on my sculpture workshop this coming Friday so why not celebrate the arrival of spring by making something amazing for your garden with my help.
