I have been running Willow Sculpture Workshops at various new venues over the last few months throughout the UK but still love to host the days at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire. It is a lovely venue with a great, well ventilated room and bags of space. The cafe does super lunches and the cakes... well they speak for themselves!

I never invite more then 6 people to attend and don't dictate what people make, so as long as it is achievable in the day I am up for a challenge. We can decide after the first hour whether we need to be a little less ambitious in order to finish but it is rare that we ever have to change plan. If you would like to discuss ideas before hand please feel free to contact me.

Castle Park Arts Centre is easily accessible by car, bus or train, contact me for more details.
