Gift cards make great presents.

I can make up a gift card for any monetary value you wish. This can then be redeemed against the purchase of a willow sculpture or a place on one of my willow sculpture workshop days.

Just to be clear, the gift card costs you nothing, all your payment can be redeemed against a future purchase.

[Contact me](/#contact) for more details.
