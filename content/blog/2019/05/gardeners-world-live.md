Caroline has been commissioned to make a new willow sculpture for The Marie Curie Garden at Gardeners World Live at The NEC from 13th -16th June.

Come along and meet her, and have a go at a bit of willow weaving yourself with her help, on Thursday 13th June on The Marie Curie Garden. A great charity and one close to Caroline's heart.
