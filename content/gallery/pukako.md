A Pukako, one of the most amazing birds from New Zealand. 

I was lucky enough to see them on a visit a few years ago and vowed to make a sculpture one day to remind me of a fantastic trip. I hope to get back there before too long.

The bird is made from two varieties of willow to give the colour variations and has wire legs.
