This last few weeks have been very strange. I never thought we would be in a position where I couldn't go out if I wanted to, or that I would have to cancel all of my workshops and not get to spend time with my amazing students. But, here we are, and with no idea yet when things will start to change back to a more normal state.

I can't pretend things have been easy. During the first week of lock-down I think virtually every email I received was a cancellation of work or a request for a refund for a workshop reservation. I have never been in such a position and I confess at times, like many I think, I have felt quite sad. I think I am getting better used to the situation now and am trying to keep things interesting on Facebook and Instagram at least, with regular postings of work that I have already done that has had to be kept secret until now. I hope people are liking the work I have done over the last six months for Hampton Court Palace. I am very proud of these massive figures and I hope it won't be too long before the palace is open again and people will be able to see them in the flesh.

In the meantime, I am working on a number of small private commissions and am always happy to discuss ideas for new work. So if you have ever fancied something willowy then please get in touch. I'd love to hear from you.
