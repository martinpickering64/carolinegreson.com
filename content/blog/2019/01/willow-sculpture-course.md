Spend the day in the comfortable surroundings of Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire and learn from Caroline how to make birds and animals entirely from willow.

You decide what you would like to make, with the only restriction being one of time. Talk to Caroline beforehand if you have a specific idea, she always loves a challenge!

You will go home at the end of the day with a piece of art you will be proud of.

Below are listed just a couple of comments received from previous students;

"_Thank you for Friday’s course. I enjoyed it enormously and I am extremely proud of my duck! It is in ‘pride of place’ in the kitchen at the moment._"

"_Many thanks for such an informative and entertaining workshop on Friday. I absolutely loved it._"
