Stags prove to be one of the most popular willow sculptures I make. They look fantastic in the garden and create an impressive focal point to any situation.

I can make the stag to fit your site so don't worry if this example wont work for you.

The sculpture is made entirely from willow with a wire threaded through the legs to ensure a good anchor outside.
