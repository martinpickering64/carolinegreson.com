<p class="lead">I regularly run my own Willow Sculpture Workshops and Basketry Workshops to assist those who are interested in exploring working with Willow to create their own Sculptures and Baskets.</p>

I will be running workshops from my home studio near Chester from March 2026 onward, and will be as flexible as I can be over dates. I can accommodate up to a maximum of 3 people comfortably in my studio so you will be guaranteed to receive help and advice when you need it.

Please [contact me](/#contact) for more information or to discuss potential dates.

Home studio workshop days are priced at £110 per person. This includes all materials and tea/coffee, please bring your own lunch.

My workshops are quite informal and are structured around the needs and
interests of those who attend. You won't be limited to making something
that I decide, in fact the only limitation will be the time we have. If
you have a particular idea, I am very happy to talk with you beforehand
about the feasibility of completing the sculpture within the day. Equally
don't worry if you don't know what to make before you arrive. We can always
discuss some possibilities during the first part of the workshop.

I can supply Gift Cards that make excellent presents and can be redeemed
for Willow Sculptures, Willow Sculpture Workshops or Basketry Workshops to
the value of the card, or in part payment for a sculpture or a workshop.

If you would like to book a place on any of my home studio workshops, please [contact me](/#contact).

I also teach at a number of other Craft Workshops and have included dates for these in the list below. Bookings for these are handled by the venue directly.

Here are the upcoming Workshops that I will be running:
