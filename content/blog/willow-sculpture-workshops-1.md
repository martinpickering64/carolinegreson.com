If you would like to spend a day (or two) at my home studio in Tarvin learning the art of willow sculpture or basketry then please get in touch.

Whilst it isn't currently possible to run my regular day workshops at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham I am happy to invite people to work with me at my purpose built, wood burner warmed studio in the garden of my home in Tarvin, near Chester. To ensure social distancing I am limiting numbers to a maximum of 2 people, unless you want to come with people from your Covid bubble.

Covid secure measures are in place.

I am willing to select a date that works for you (as long as I am not committed elsewhere) rather than scheduling specific workshop dates.

Please contact me at mail@carolinegregson.com to discuss ideas.
