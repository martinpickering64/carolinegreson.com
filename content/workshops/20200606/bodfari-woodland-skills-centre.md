Caroline will again be teaching a 2-day Willow Sculpture Workshop at The Woodland Skills Centre at Bodfari, Denbighshire.

This is a beautiful venue overlooking the Clwydian mountains with its own campsite if you fancy staying over.

The workshop will take place over the weekend of 6th/7th June 2020. Ideal for tackling a bigger sculpture such as deer, sheep or a small flock of birds. For further details and booking go to [www.woodlandskillscentre.co.uk](http://woodlandskillscentre.co.uk/event-registration/?ee=35).
