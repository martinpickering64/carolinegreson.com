I ran the first Willow Sculpture Workshop back at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham last week since the first lockdown. It was lovely to be back. I will be running regular dates there again throughout 2022.

The room is large so even with the maximum number of 6 participants we can stay well spread out with everyone having their own table. There is an outside door which will remain open along with opening skylights so airflow through the room is great. It all feels very safe.

For dates and availability have a look in the [workshops section of the website](/workshops/).

I handle all bookings myself so contact me by email [mail@carolinegregson.com](mailto:mail@carolinegregson.com) or phone [07989 751469](tel:+447989751469) to book your place.

Hope to see you there!
