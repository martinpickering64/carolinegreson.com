Caroline will be teaching 2 days of Willow Sculpture at Starlight Cottage near Buckland in the Cotwolds, located between Oxford and Faringdon. This will be my only workshop this year in this part of the country.

The dates are 9th and 10th August 2022.

Details and booking through www.starlightcottage.co.uk (look in their Nature and Mindfulness page).

As always I don't dictate what you will make, so anything is possible. The only limit we have is time so maybe don't choose something too huge! Contact me if you would like to discuss ideas.

I hope to see you there.
