I have just uploaded the dates of my day workshops at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire for 2019.

Cost will remain at Â£70 and class size is small, no more than 6 people. You can make whatever you want within the time constraints and Caroline will help you achieve something you will be proud of. No experience necessary.
