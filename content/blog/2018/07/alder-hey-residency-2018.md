Caroline has been appointed as Artist in Residence at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for the second year. Following on from the success of her 2017 residency, Caroline has been asked back to work with 2 new wards during the autumn of this year.

"I can't wait to work with the children, families and staff again. It was such a privilege last year to be welcomed into what can be a frightening exhausting and stressful situation and to help make some amazing sculptures. We have had more than a few laughs too. To feel that I have diverted attention away from the unpleasant aspects of a hospital stay for at least a short period of the day and to make a child smile who maybe hasn't been, that makes my job amazing."
