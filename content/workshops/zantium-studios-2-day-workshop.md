Caroline will again be teaching her popular 2-day workshops at Zantium Studios near Wirksworth, Derbyshire on 18th and 19th September 2025.

With having a full 2 days, we have the opportunity to make bigger sculptures, deer or sheep are always popular but other animals are also possible. Caroline will always try and help you create what you want.
