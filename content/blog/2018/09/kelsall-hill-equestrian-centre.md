Caroline has created some new willow sculptures to dress one of the cross country fences at the next British Eventing Horse Trials competition at Kelsall Hill Equestrian Centre in Cheshire on 21st, 22nd and 23rd September.

'Handstand Man' , a lifesize representation of absolute joy, will be tumbling his way across the fields alongside his faithful two hounds.
