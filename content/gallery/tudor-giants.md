These 9ft tall willow figures were commissioned by Hampton Court Palace as part of their celebrations of the 500th Anniversary of The Field of Cloth of Gold when King Henry VIII met France's King Francois. The figures are inspired by characters depicted on the famous Field of Cloth of Gold painting which hangs in the palace.
