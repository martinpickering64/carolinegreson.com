title: New Workshops Options
subtitle: Come and learn with me at my Home Workshop near Chester
summary: >-
  In 2026 I will be offering the option to come and learn willow sculpture or
  basketmaking with me in my comfortable workshop near Chester. Groups of no
  more than 3 people will mean we can tailor the contents to what you want to
  make and there will be time for lots of individual attention if needed. I am
  happy to arrange a date that suits us and other than avoiding existing
  commitments any day will be fine.
