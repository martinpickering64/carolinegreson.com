**Covid-19 Additional information:**

_I have limited student numbers for this workshop to a maximum of 4 people, so social distancing can be maintained, and I will ask that students do not attend if they are feeling at all unwell or have been asked to isolate. It will be possible to run the workshop from my home studio in Tarvin in the event of the Arts Centre being unavailable, using both studio space and a gazebo covered lawn. You should bring your own refreshments/lunch. In the event of necessary late cancellation due to movement restrictions, all reservations can be either refunded or moved to a later date. Please contact me if you have any questions._

Workshop to learn how to make willow sculptures. You can choose what you make. This one-day workshop shows you the techniques and materials I use in my own work to create sculptures from willow. The group is kept small so you will get help when you need it.

The workshop is held at Castle Park Arts Centre in Frodsham, Cheshire and runs from 10AM to 4PM (bring your own lunch or buy some in the excellent Arts Centre Cafe).

Previous experience of basketry or working with willow is not essential. At the end of the day you will be able to take home your completed sculpture. Previous workshops have resulted in chickens, ducks, herons and other birds and for those with more experience pigs, cats, hares etc.

All tools and materials are provided.
