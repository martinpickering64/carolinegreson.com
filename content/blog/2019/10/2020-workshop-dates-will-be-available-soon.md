With 2019 rapidly heading to a close, all of my willow sculpture workshops for 2019 are now full. Please contact me if you would like to be put on a waiting list in case of any late cancellations.

I will be finalising the dates for my 2020 schedule of willow sculpture workshops in the next few weeks so please let me know if you would like to get an early notification of these and I will email them to you as soon as I know them myself.

Hope to see you in 2020.
