Caroline will again be teaching her popular 2-day workshops at Zantium Studios near Wirksworth, Derbyshire on 13th and 14th May 2021. 

With having 2 days we have the opportunity to make bigger sculptures, deer or sheep are popular but other animals are also possible.

A lovely venue with options to work inside or out if the weather is good, super lunches and afternoon cake included! Contact Alison at Zantium direct for more information and bookings [www.zantium.co.uk](www.zantium.co.uk) or [01629 824377](tel:01629824377).
