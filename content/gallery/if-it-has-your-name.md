Made for the Cheshire Artists Network touring exhibition "WW1 Reflections and Reconciliation".

This piece was inspired by an old photograph I found of an enormous pile of empty baskets made to carry individual artillery shells. I was shocked to learn of the huge number of baskets that were woven for transporting individual missiles by horse to the front lines, and to think of what those numbers mean in terms of the horror that was the trenches. This work is a reflection of the handcrafted nature of much that was used during the Great War. The names woven on to the basket are those of the brave men from my village who gave their lives.
