I will be teaching a Willow Basketmaking day on Friday 8th October between 9.30 and 4pm at the Cheshire Crafts Workshop at Blakemere Village near Sandiway in Cheshire.

We will be making traditional willow round baskets with or without handles depending on how fast you work. I will provide an assortment of willow (some locally grown) for you to choose from so you can make the design your own using the natural colours of the bark. 

This is a great introduction to basketmaking and requires no previous experience.
