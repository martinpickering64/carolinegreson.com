Caroline is teaching her ever popular 2-day willow sculpture workshop on 19th/20th September 2019, at Zantium Studios near Wirksworth in Derbyshire.

This is a great opportunity to make a larger sculpture. Previous workshops have resulted in all sorts of dogs, deer, sheep, dragons even a unicorn. Talk to Caroline if you would like to discuss ideas.

There is only one available place on this workshop now so if you would like to come then don't delay booking.

Contact Alison at Zantium direct for more information and bookings https://www.zantium.co.uk.
