Willow is a fantastic material to use in sculpture. I use one year old growth (withies or rods) from coppiced willow trees, some of which I grow and harvest locally myself. It would be hard to think of a more sustainable material.

I have loved and been inspired by the natural world since I was a child
and the ability to work as a Willow Artist and make willow sculptures
representing the essence of animals, birds and other living forms now
brings me great pleasure. I love to represent movement and vitality in
my work. My willow sculptures appear to have just paused in their setting
before they are ready to move on. One of the nicest things anyone has
said about my animal sculptures is that you can always see where
they are looking!

The excellence of Caroline's work as a Willow Artist and Basketmaker has
been recognised by her admission as Yeoman member of the Worshipful
Company of Basketmakers.
